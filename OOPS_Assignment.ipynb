        "\n",
        "Ans:  Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications. By understanding the core OOP principles (classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction), programmers can leverage the full potential of Python OOP capabilities to design elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.\n",

        "OOPs is a way of organizing code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behavior. In OOPs, object has attributes thing that has specific data and can perform certain actions using methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: Encapsulation and abstraction are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). As a result, they play an essential role in the design and structure of classes and objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. Direct access to some components of an object is restricted while controlled access is provided through methods. Objects should be designed to hide the internal implementation details and expose only what is needed to interact with them from the outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers like private ('__') and protected ('_') to control the visibility of attributes and methods. However, Python enforces access control through convention rather than strict enforcement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction, on the other hand, is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors. It allows you to represent essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It helps manage complexity by separating what an object does (methods) from how it achieves it (implementation details).\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, abstraction is often achieved through the use of abstract base classes (ABCs). ABCs define a common interface that subclasses are expected to implement. This allows you to specify what methods must be present in a class without providing a complete implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "To sum up the difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation emphasizes data hiding and controlled access to attributes and methods within a class. Basically, it's about packaging related data and behavior together and limiting external access to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction emphasizes the creation of clear and simplified interfaces that hide implementation details. In other words, it's defining a common structure that focuses on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",

        "6Que: Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or base class). This promotes code reuse, modularity, and a hierarchical class structure. In this article, we'll explore inheritance in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basic Example of Inheritance:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism is a foundational concept in programming that allows entities like functions, methods or operators to behave differently based on the type of data they are handling. Derived from Greek, the term literally means \"many forms\".\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Examples include method overloading and operator overloading, where multiple functions or operators can share the same name but perform different tasks based on the context.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class. This helps to control access to the internal state of an object and prevent accidental modification from outside the class.\n",

        "21Que: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The __del__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overview the Python __del__ Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: The __del__ method is used to define the actions that should be performed before an object is destroyed. This can include releasing external resources such as files or database connections associated with the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage: When Python's garbage collector identifies that an object is no longer referenced by any part of the program, it schedules the __del__ method of that object to be called before reclaiming its memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax: The __del__ method is defined using the following syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "class ClassName:\n",
        "\n",
        "        def __del__(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "         pass\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Calling the __del__ Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is automatically called by Python's garbage collector when an object’s reference count drops to zero. Here are three straightforward examples demonstrating how and when the __del__ method is invoked:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: Class method vs Static Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between the Class method and the static method is:\n",
        "\n",
        "A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.\n",
        "We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.\n",

        "\n",
        "23Que: How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Inheritance in Python refers to the process by which one class can acquire the attributes and methods of another class. This is done by creating an inheritance relationship between the two classes. The class that is doing the inheriting is referred to as the child class, and the class that is being inherited from is referred to as the parent class. Polymorphism in Python is the ability of one object to take on multiple forms. This is done by creating multiple classes inherited from a single base class. Each class can then be used interchangeably, as they all share the same interface. This allows for a great degree of flexibility when it comes to programming. To demonstrate how to work with inheritance and polymorphism in Python, consider the following inheritance in python example of a class hierarchy for a game character.\n",

        "24Que: What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method chaining is a powerful technique in Python programming that allows us to call multiple methods on an object in a single, continuous line of code. This approach makes the code cleaner, more readable, and often easier to maintain. It is frequently used in data processing, object-oriented programming, and frameworks such as Pandas, Django ORM, and Flask..\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "text = \" hello, gfg! \"\n",

        "\n",
        "25Que: What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Python has a set of built-in methods and __call__ is one of them. The __call__ method enables Python programmers to write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function. When this method is defined, calling an object (obj(arg1, arg2)) automatically triggers obj.__call__(arg1, arg2). This makes objects behave like functions, enabling more flexible and reusable code.\n",
